QUARTZ.NET CHANGELOG
==============================
http://quartznet.sourceforge.net


Release 0.6, August 4, 2007
-----------------------------

Bug

    * [QRTZNET-18] - JobDataMap cannot convert Int32 values correctly from string representation
    * [QRTZNET-20] - CronExpression fails when minute is incremented to 60
    * [QRTZNET-21] - DailyCalendar.GetTimeRangeEndingTime reports starting time instead of ending time
    * [QRTZNET-24] - AnnualCalendar.SetDayExcluded(d, false) does not work
    * [QRTZNET-25] - StringKeyDirtyFlagMap lacks Put(string, int)
    * [QRTZNET-27] - RamJobStore.StoreTrigger incorrectly removes JobDetail when replacing trigger
    * [QRTZNET-28] - CronTrigger: Hour, Minute, and Second parameters describe an un-representable DateTime
    * [QRTZNET-29] - RAMJobStore.RemoveCalendar fails when triggers are present
    * [QRTZNET-31] - CronExpression GetTimeAfter() fails with System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException

Improvement

    * [QRTZNET-7] - Load balanced database support
    * [QRTZNET-22] - CronExpression should all extra white space from expression
    * [QRTZNET-23] - IScheduler.SchedulerJob should throw always exception if trigger's calendar cannot be found
    * [QRTZNET-26] - Change trigger instructions and states to enum values
    * [QRTZNET-33] - Remove confusing Durability and Volatility properties from JobDetail

New Feature

    * [QRTZNET-3] - AdoJobStore support
    * [QRTZNET-16] - Quartz default properties should be read from embedded resource inside the assembly

Task

    * [QRTZNET-17] - CronTrigger misfire instruction constants should be made public
    * [QRTZNET-30] - Upgrade Common.Logging libraries to 1.1
    * [QRTZNET-34] - Rename Schedulder_Fields class to more describing SchedulerConstants
    * [QRTZNET-35] - Change Quartz initialization properties to use "type" instead of "class" to be more .NET like

Other:

Breaking changes:

 * Quartz.NET initialization property keys now use "*.type" instead of "*.class", you need to update configuration
   or if you are fine with defaults you can also ditch configuration from app.config (see QRTZNET-16)
   
 * Trigger instructions and states are now enum values instead of old class constants
 
 * There's no longer properties named Durablity or Volatility, only Durable and Volatile (JobDetail & Trigger) 
   
 * Class Scheduler_Fields was renamed to SchedulerConstants


Special thanks for Drew Burlingame for string concatenation and TreeSet performance patches
and Anton Dvinskiy for hunting down bugs, finding good places to refactor and patches
for Quartz and its tests.

Task

    * [QRTZNET-1] - Merge changes between 1.5.1 and 1.5.2

Other:
