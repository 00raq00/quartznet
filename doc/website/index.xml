				Quartz.NET is a port of very propular open source Java job scheduling framework, <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz">Quartz</a>. 
				This project owes very much to original Java project, it's father James House and
				the project contributors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Quartz.NET is a pure .NET library written in C# which currently targets Framework version 1.1 and above.
				Quartz.NET is feature-wise equal to Quartz Java 1.6 excluding Java specifics. Quartz.NET
				is already running in production systems and has received good feedback.

					Special thanks to James House and his team for their continuous
					effort to make Quartz better.

				<title>Quartz.NET 1.0 RC 2 Released</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">August 6, 2008 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quartz.NET 1.0 RC 2 has been released. This release is the 
					second release candidate for final 1.0 release. 
				</p>

				<p>
					This release contains late minute breaking change. All time
					interval and duration related data that was presented with
					longs or ints before is now presented with TimeSpans which
					is a more natural way for .NET. This change will cause
					compile time errors that should be quite easy to fix using
					TimeSpan.FromXXX methods. Where you earlier had 5000 milliseconds
					you can now use a more convenient form of TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5).
				</p>
