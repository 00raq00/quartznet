				Quartz.NET is a port of very propular open source Java job scheduling framework, <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz">Quartz</a>. 
				This project owes very much to original Java project, it's father James House and
				the project contributors.

				Quartz.NET is a pure .NET library written in C# which currently targets Framework version 1.1 and above.
				Quartz.NET is feature-wise equal to Quartz Java 1.6 excluding Java specifics. Quartz.NET
				is already running in production systems and has received good feedback.

				<title>Quartz.NET 1.0.3 Released</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">August 22, 2010 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quartz.NET 1.0.3 has been released.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a maintenance release with bug fixes for the 1.0 version of Quartz.NET and is an adviced update for all users. 
					This release supports .NET 1.1., 2.0 and 3.5 SP1, there is still no official support for .NET 4.0 but you should have
					no problems running Quartz.NET with .NET 4.0 using the binaries compiled for framework 3.5.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Quartz.NET 1.0 maintenance branch will not receive any new features, only bug fixes. 
					Further development efforts will go to Quartz.NET vNext that will have support only for .NET Framework 3.5 and later.
				</p>
				<p>
					This version roughly corresponds to Java Quartz's version 1.6.6.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please refer to the
					<a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=21840&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=10110">release notes</a> 
					and the readme.txt in the release bundle for more information.

				<title>Performance advisory for high load database installations</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">August 22, 2010 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					People running installations with large amount of triggers (thousands) should consider changing their db schema to
					use nvarchar columns instead of the varchar that is the default for Quartz.NET 1.0 db creation scripts. Quartz.NET sends parameters as 
					nvarchar and when used against varchar indexes this will most likely cause index scan instead of better performing index seek.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the future Quartz.NET will come with SQL scripts that will create nvarchar columns instead of varchar columns.
