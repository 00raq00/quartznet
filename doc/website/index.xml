				<cite>Quartz.NET is a full-featured, open source job scheduling system that can be used from smallest apps to large scale enterprise systems.</cite>
			</p>
			<p>
				Quartz.NET is a port of very propular open source Java job scheduling framework, <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz">Quartz</a>. 
				This project owes very much to original Java project, it's father James House and
				the project contributors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Quartz.NET is a pure .NET library written in C# which currently targets Framework version 1.1 and above.
				Quartz.NET has already almost caught up with Quartz Java 1.6 and there aren't so many things missing. Quartz.NET
				is running in some production systems and has received good feedback.

				<title>Quartz.NET 0.x Released</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">November XX, 2007 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quartz.NET 0.x has been released. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This is again a big feature release and this release also constains 
					some minor bug fixes. The biggest new features are support for XML
					configuration of jobs and triggers and remoting support for scheduler.
					XML configuration should make it easier
					to define your scheduling out-of-code regardless of the used job store and
					remoting allows you to control scheduler over application domain boundaries.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						This release has also major breaking change: all times
						are now expected to be in UTC format for Quartz.NET to work
						correctly.
					</strong>
					<br />
					Please check <a href="migration_guide.html">migration guide</a>
					before upgrading.
				</p>
				<p>
					Complete release notes available in JIRA TODO.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now that version 0.6 was released with quite impressive feature set
					it's a good time to sit back and elaborate a bit what's been up with the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Project has received free license for Clover.NET from kind folks at <a href="http://www.cenqua.com/">Cenqua</a>
					(actually now Atlassian - the're cool people too!),
					and did we receive it right on time - product will be discontinued and I believe no 
					further licenses will be given. Cenqua also has opened a 
					<a href="http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/browse/quartznet">FishEye view of the source code</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The folks at <a href="http://www.innovasys.com">Innovasys</a> also support open source and they gave us a free license
					for their excellent source code documentation management software <a href="http://www.innovasys.com/products/documentx.asp">Document! X</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					So what's going to happen next? We've caught up with Java version 1.6 already quite nicely but there are still a couple of big things to do:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>XML based configuration support - ability to define jobs and triggers in XML configuration file</li>
					<li>Spring.NET support - actually I've already got running code that seems to work but there are still some issues to solve</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					After XML configuration is working and released (planned for 0.7) it's getting close to 1.0 time. Even though
					Quartz.NET is quite production ready as-is, it'll be considered 1.0 when it's also feature ready.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please remember, It's your feedback that drives this project! So don't hesitate to bring up the the good and the bad
					in Quartz.NET. We gladly accept bug reports (better yet with test code to illustrate and maybe even a patch to fix it!)
					to our <a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/QRTZNET">JIRA issue tracker</a> and welcome questions and help 
					requests to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/quartznet">Quartz.NET mailing list</a>. It would also be great
					to hear about projects/products using Quartz.NET!

				<title>Quartz.NET 0.6 Released</title>
				<p>
				<div class="descr">August 4, 2007 by Marko Lahma</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Quartz.NET 0.6 has been released. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This both feature and bug fix release. The new biggest feature is AdoJobStore
					that currently supports SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
					With AdoJobStore comes also clustering. Please give it a go (Example 13 has an example 
					for SQL Server) and give us feedback!
				</p>
				<p>
					This release also fixes many problems found by users, most notably CronExpression problems
					when having a more frequent firing schedule, like every nth second or minute.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now minimal configuration is also automatically loaded from Quartz.NET embedded resource, 
					so if you don't want to change the default configuration, you don't need to type anything anymore.
					See <a href="http://jira.opensymphony.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10110&amp;styleName=Html&amp;version=21710">
					release notes</a> for more details.
