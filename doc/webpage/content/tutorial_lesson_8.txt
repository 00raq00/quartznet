Lesson 8: SchedulerListeners

SchedulerListeners are much like TriggerListeners and JobListeners, except they receive notification of events within the Scheduler itself - not necessarily events related to a specific trigger or job.

Scheduler-related events include: the addition of a job/trigger, the removal of a job/trigger, a serious error within the scheduler, notification of the scheduler being shutdown, and others.
The org.quartz.SchedulerListener Interface

public interface SchedulerListener {

    public void jobScheduled(Trigger trigger);

    public void jobUnscheduled(String triggerName, String triggerGroup);

    public void triggerFinalized(Trigger trigger);

    public void triggersPaused(String triggerName, String triggerGroup);

    public void triggersResumed(String triggerName, String triggerGroup);

    public void jobsPaused(String jobName, String jobGroup);

    public void jobsResumed(String jobName, String jobGroup);

    public void schedulerError(String msg, SchedulerException cause);

    public void schedulerShutdown();

}

SchedulerListeners are created and registered in much the same way as the other listener types, except there is no distinction between global and non-global listeners. SchedulerListeners can be virtually any object that implements the org.quartz.SchedulerListener interface.
