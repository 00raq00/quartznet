<h1>Welcome to the home of Quartz Enterprise Scheduler .NET!</h1>
<br />
<cite>Quartz.NET is a full-featured, open source job scheduling system that can be used from smallest apps to large scale enterprise systems.</cite>

<p>
	Quartz.NET is a port of very propular open source Java job scheduling framework, <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz">Quartz</a>. 
	Most of the work has already been done on the Java side. This project owes very much to original Java project, it's father James House and
	the other contributors.
	Quart.NET is still very much work in progress, all feedback and suggestions are greatly welcome.
